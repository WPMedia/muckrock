In addition, MuckRock staff and outside contributors are using these primary source documents received through the site to create <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/\">original investigative reporting and analysis</a>.\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock's unique form of <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/project/the-private-prison-project-8/\">investigative and accountability journalism</a> has been recognized by the Sunlight Foundation, The Freedom of the Press Foundation, and hundreds of local and national news outlets for its groundbreaking work in areas such as government spending, surveillance, and public safety.\r\n\r\n<p>Government materials on MuckRock are available free of charge and, with some exceptions, without restriction. Filing requests through MuckRock <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/accounts/signup/\">starts at just $20 to file up to four requests</a>, which includes advice, postage, follow up, and hosting of the materials in an easy-to-use format.\r\n\r\n<div align=center>\r\n <id=\"create-request-button\">\r\n                <a href=\"/accounts/signup/\" class=\"primary button\">\r\n                    Get Started!\r\n                </a></div>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock is a member of the <a href=\"http://gijn.org/\">Global Investigative Journalism Network</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div align=center><a href=\"http://gijn.org/\"><img src=\"https://d3gn0r3afghep.cloudfront.net/news_photos/2017/02/12/Logo_transp_bckground.png\"></a></div>",

We&#8217;re working on packaging up your request and getting it to the agency. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours, particularly for the Treasury Department which has its own special rules. If you notice one of your requests has been &#8220;processing&#8221; for an extremely long time, <a href=\"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">e-mail us</a> and we will try and update you on what&#8217;s going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"whythissitecantisubmitarequestonmyown\">Why this site? Can&#8217;t I submit a request on my own?</h3>\r\n<p>MuckRock was created precisely because we <i>had</i> filed requests on our own, and because we were extremely frustrated by the process: It&#8217;s often difficult to find the right contact information for an agency, to understand which laws do and don&#8217;t apply to them, and to continue following up until you get a response. MuckRock takes out all this legwork and lets you focus on what you&#8217;re interested in: The information. \u00a0Because public records requests are all we focus on, we&#8217;re also well-equipped to make sure the initial letters are well-worded and to turn stacks of paper into searchable, embeddable PDFs and spreadsheets that make it easier to find any needles in a haystack that might be lurking in your succesful request.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"canigethelp247\">Can I get help 24/7?</h3>\r\n<p>Except during brief downtimes familiar to every site, \u00a0MuckRock is available and operating 24/7/365, and you&#8217;re welcome to file a request anytime, whether it&#8217;s when you have a spark of 3 a.m. inspiration or during a 4 p.m. City Council meeting. We also have fanatical support staff accessible <a href=\"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">by e-mail</a> and willing to help out with everything from technical issues to crafting an appeal letter. We try to respond to most emails within two business days but are often much quicker.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"isthisillegalcouldigetintroubleatmyworklifeetc\">Is this illegal? Could I get in trouble at my work/life/etc?</h3>\r\n<p>MuckRock is based entirely on existing legal infrastructure and public records laws at the local, state and federal levels. Such requests are a legal right of U.S. citizens and, in fact, citizens of most countries of the world. In rare instances, agencies might accidentally release legally protected data (even FOIA officers aren&#8217;t perfect!), in which case we will work with the requester to redact or remove legally sensitive information.</p>\r\n<p>Do note, however, that public record requests, particularly those filed through MuckRock, are &#8220;public acts,&#8221; in the sense that other people can see what you requests, when you requested it, and any other information you put in the letter. This is true of almost all public records requests, whether they are filed through MuckRock or not, but MuckRock does make your requests more accessible once you remove any &#8220;embargo&#8221; you have placed on them. It is possible, though generally unlikely, that your request could result in personal repercussions at your work or in your personal life. For highly sensitive or private requests, we suggest you consult a lawyer and file privately.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"donate\">Can I donate to MuckRock?</h3>\r\n<p>If you like what we do, the best way to support MuckRock is to buy a request and file yourself, or <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/crowdfund/\">support a crowdfunding campaign for a request or project you like</a>. If you&#8217;d like to just support the site more generally, we currently don&#8217;t have a general donation tool but donations can be sent via PayPal to us at <a href=\"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">info@muckrock.com</a> or mailed to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMuckRock<br>\r\n411A Highland Ave<br />\r\nSomerville, MA 02144\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock is a registered 501c3 (EIN 81-1485228), and donations to our general operations as well as to support MuckRock staff projects are currently tax deductible, as of Feb. 17, 2016. We truly appreciate your support no matter what format it comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"doihavetousemyrealname\">Do I have to use my real name? Can I submit anonymously?</h3>\r\n<p>We highly suggest you use your real, legal name, but we do not require it and understand that often times, there are very valid reasons for using a pseudonym, group name, or other moniker that is not your legal name. Our primary concern is that using a fake name can complicate appeals or lawsuits if a request comes to that.</p>\r\n<p>Most agencies expect or require at least some name, but in some places, like Washington state, a name is not required. </p>\r\n<p>If you'd like to keep your real name private, we highly suggest taking the following steps:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When you register an account, do not ever enter your real name. While we can change usernames and you can edit your name in settings, it's best to just not have it there in the first place.</li>\r\n<li>If you're very concerned about privacy, create a new email address that is not connected to your other accounts using the same alias.</li>\r\n<li>Consider paying for your account with a prepaid credit card that you bought with cash, or pay with Bitcoin (note that Bitcoin cannot be used for recurring payments, such as a Professional account).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You can change the name associated with your account <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/accounts/update/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"canideletearequestifiled\">Can I delete a request I filed?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes, please email <a href=\"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">info@muckrock.com</a> with the request or requests you&#8217;d like deleted. Please note that many government agencies keep records of the requests they receive, and may post them themselves or release this information to other entities. We cannot control this distribution by the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"caniuseamuckrockstaffersnameorsayiamonstaff\">Can I use a MuckRock staffer&#8217;s name or say I am on staff?</h3>\r\n<p>Please do not do this without prior consent from us. In some rare cases, we will agree to help file a request on behalf of our organization if it fits with an editorial project we are interested in, but this is rare. If you&#8217;d like to partner on a project or suggest a request for us to file, please email <a href=\"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">info@muckrock.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"ifiusemuckrockdoigettotakeadvantageofitspreferredfeestatus\">If I use MuckRock, do I get to take advantage of its preferred fee status?</h3>\r\n<p>No. Using MuckRock to file and track your requests is like using the UPS Store to mail and receive letters. It does not affect the fee category that the government assigns you to. Different governments have different criteria for preferred fee categories, and your request should explain how you personally meet those criteria regardless of whether or not you are using MuckRock. The only requesters who may take advantage of MuckRock\u2019s preferred fee category are our staffers. If you contribute to MuckRock\u2019s reporting and wish to say that you should be treated as staff, see above for how to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"oncesomeonesubmitsarequestwheredoesitendupdoesitgodirectlytothelocalstategovernmentagency\">Once someone submits a request, where does it end up? Does it go directly to the local/state/government agency?</h3>\r\n<p>For the vast majority of requests, submitting it instantly sends the request off to the best contact person we have listed for the appropriate agency in our database, usually via e-mail or fax. Occasionally, requests have to be checked over or submitted via snail mail, which can slow this process, but the requests all eventually go to the agency directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"canisubmitarequestviamuckrockandhaveitbeprivateforever\">Can I submit a request via MuckRock and have it be private forever?</h3>\r\n<p>We generally discourage permanent embargos. Users that are part of organizational accounts can embargo their requests permanently. Professional users can ask for an embargoed request to be deleted, and we&#8217;ll remove it completely from the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"howlongdoyouholdontothedocuments\">How long do you hold onto the documents?</h3>\r\n<p>Digital documents we hold onto indefinitely: Hopefully as close to forever as we can, since they&#8217;re generally public documents paid for by the people.</p>\r\n<p>Paper responses we keep on file for at least one year, and then plan to discard over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"crowdfund\"><strong>Crowdfunding</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock offers tools to help crowdfund requests and public records projects that require funding to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"howcanicrowdfundfeesforarequestifiled\">How can I crowdfund fees for a request I filed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For any request that has fees associated with it, a &#8220;Crowdfund&#8221; button will appear at the top of the request page. Simply click it and follow the prompts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"howcanicrowdfundanewsorpublicrecordsrelatedproject\">How can I crowdfund a news or public records related project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Project crowdfunding is currently in a private beta. If you&#8217;re interested in using this feature, please email <a href=\"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">info@muckrock.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifacrowdfundingcampaigndoesntmeetitsgoal\">What happens if a crowdfunding campaign doesn&#8217;t meet its goal?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We will work with the agency to release a portion of the requested documents in exchange for the money that was raised. In the case of crowdfunded projects, we will work with the users who created the campaign to fund a portion of the proposed project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the agency or user is unable or unwilling to process part of the project or request, we will apply the funds to other public records fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"whathappensifacampaignraisesmorethanitsgoal\">What happens if a campaign raises more than its goal?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For projects, additional funding will be used to expand the scope and depth of the project. For records requests, crowdfunding campaigns that exceed their goals will be used to either expand the scope of the records request or be applied to other requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"whatfeesareinvolvedincrowdfundingcampaigns\">What fees are involved in crowdfunding campaigns?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a 15% fee added to crowdfunding campaigns that covers credit card and other processing costs.</p>",

You may optionally supply other information that can be used to contact you or identify you as an individual, including your postal address and phone number (collectively, \u201cOptional Personally Identifiable Information\u201d). We use Personally Identifiable Information and Optional Personally Identifiable Information to communicate with you and to assist in processing and managing your requests. When you register on the Site, we also require you to set up an account and, at that time, MuckRock will collect your username, user ID number, and a hashed password. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Integral in managing and processing your public records requests, MuckRock additionally collects the following information: your account type, your Stripe ID associated with your credit card information, your user profile URL, the number of non-expiring and number of expiring requests you have, the date that subscriptions renew, what requests you follow, the kind of status your account has (<em>e.g.</em> \u201cactive,\u201d \u201cblocked,\u201d \u201cstaff,\u201d or \u201csuperuser\u201d), your last login and the date you joined, the requests you have filed, and the agencies with which you have filed these requests. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our payment processor, Stripe, collects and stores information necessary for making payments including your credit card information, your e-mail address, your Stripe ID, the date you registered, your MuckRock username, your subscription information, and logs of certain activities and interactions (<em>e.g.</em> when your account was created and every transaction you make with Stripe)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How We Store Information We Collect</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except for the information collected and stored by Stripe (as described above), all other information is stored by MuckRock inside MuckRock\u2019s Django app. This information may be further organized or broken down into the following headings and categories, such as: title, URL of request, status of request, jurisdiction, agency, date submitted, date response was received, date request is due, days until request is due, date MuckRock will follow-up with request, whether the request is currently embargoed, date the embargo extends until, price of the request if the government is charging, description of the request, whether the request is featured, whether special data should be displayed on the side of the request, the request\u2019s government-provided tracking ID number, whether the user has viewed the request since the request was last updated, the number of page views the request has, what e-mail address the request was sent to and/or from, what other e-mail addresses were copied in the correspondence, tags used to organize the request, and MuckRock\u2019s internal tracking ID. Metadata associated with every communication included as part of your request shall also be collected and stored. This may include the name of sender, name of receiver, data and time sent, whether it is to or from the user, whether the request uses HTML, the contents of the body of the message, whether that communication changed the status of the request, how may pages an attachment, a description of an attachment, and a copy of an attached file. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> <strong>How we share information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except as noted below, MuckRock does not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties unless you give us your permission or we need to share such information in order to provide the services you have requested. When we supply Personally Identifiable Information to these third parties, we require them to use it only for the function they are helping us with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, comply with subpoenas, court orders or legal process served on MuckRock, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, and to protect the property or interests of MuckRock, its agents and employees, personal safety, or the public.

Originally made possible by a grant from the Sunlight Foundation, the service is now funded primarily by its users, including journalists, researchers, activists, and people who just want to better understand what their government is up to. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using MuckRock is easy, and it's free to try it out and see if it's a good fit for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Turn your idea into a request</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to get started is to simply file a request: Click \"Create a FOIA Request\" at the top right on any page, and a short form will help walk you through the required steps. MuckRock has a database of tens of thousands of government agencies and almost every single city, town and county, so when asked where you'd like to submit your request, you can generally just type the first few letters and we'll show a list of places we have.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><img src=\"https://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Filing%20Screen.png\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Occasionally, we won't have an agency saved in our database: You can just enter the agency's name, and we'll take care of the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get the request where it needs to be \u2014 without the work</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock directly sends and receives all requests and responses, including scanning in any final paperwork. With a contact database of over ten thousand agencies from across the nation \u2013 from your local police to the CIA \u2013 getting your request to the right place is as simple as typing a name.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Share your discoveries with the world ... when you're ready</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Documents come in carbon but get to you digitally \u2013 a permanent archive you can share with a simple link. Don't want to be scooped on an important story? Professional users can embargo requests, keeping them private until the user chooses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filing requests through MuckRock starts at just $20 to file up to four requests, with the opportunity to earn free requests through MuckRock's assignment system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you a journalist or researcher interested in even more features? Check out our Professional Accounts, with the ability to embargo requests, the cheapest rates, and additional features to meet the needs of journalists, researchers, and others who use public records professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An organization or think tank that's looking to embrace FOIA in a big way?

        "content": "<h1 id=\"gettingstartedwithpublicrecords\u2014andmuckrock\">Getting started with public records \u2014 and MuckRock</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Filing your first public records request, whether to the National Security Agency or to your local library, can be daunting: What will actually get your question answered? What does the law say? What if the agency rejects your request?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock is here to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, decide what kind of question your trying to get answered, and figure out which level of government is likely to have data on that question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the keys to a good public records request is remembering that you&#8217;re not asking a question \u2014 your asking for documents that answer a question. So instead of asking how many dogs live in your city, <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/foi/arlington-450/dog-registration-data-arlington-town-clerk-9900/\">ask for the dog license registry</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost everything the government does creates some paper trail, whether that&#8217;s a log, a report, a presentation before a big project, <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/foi/united-states-of-america-10/hurricane-katrina-lessons-learned-1894/\">lessons learned after a natural disaster</a>, or <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/foi/united-states-of-america-10/dhs-oia-threat-of-radicalization-and-extremism-intranet-224/\">even a copy of an agency&#8217;s Intranet page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who was likely to have met about the information you&#8217;re interested in? How do <em>you</em> know the documents you&#8217;re interested in exist?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes including a link to a news article or press release about the documents can help the agency find what you&#8217;re request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the important thing is to file something: 100 percent of requests that aren&#8217;t filed get nothing back. In fact, very successful requesters, like Jason Leopold, <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/2013/jul/12/jason-leopold-foia-terrorist-shares-his-transparen/\">file a dozen or more requests a week</a>. Not all of them will be successful, but filing a number of requests today increases the chances that interesting material will come back to you for weeks and months to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"followthepros\">Follow the pros</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock regularly interviews FOIA experts for their advice on what they&#8217;ve learned. Here&#8217;s some of our favorite tips, plus links to the full interviews.</p>\r\n<blockquote>It is incredibly important to be as specific as possible with your request: what kind of documents you are looking for, when these documents were created and/or updated, which department is likely to hold the documents you are after, and so on. A broad request asking for all documents &#8220;pertaining to&#8221; a topic is more likely to be refused than a more specific request.</blockquote>\r\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\u2014 <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/2014/apr/11/requesters-voice-privacy-and-security-expert-runa-/\">Runa Sandvik</a></div>\r\n<blockquote>If you have a &#8220;sensitive&#8221; FOIA request or are getting jerked around, request the processing notes for it to see what the agency is saying about it.\r\n\r\n<p>Always appeal if you get rejected.</p>\r\nKnow as much of the laws and court precedents as you can.</blockquote>\r\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\u2014 <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/2014/feb/14/requesters-voice-cj-ciaramella/\">C.J. Ciaramella</a></div>\r\n<blockquote> FOIA requesters must know everything there is to know about the subject matter for which they are seeking responsive records. I would also advise first time requesters to read FOIA logs and file FOIAs for administrative case files.</blockquote>\r\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\u2014 <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/2013/jul/12/jason-leopold-foia-terrorist-shares-his-transparen/\">Jason Leopold</a></div>\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"betterknowyourlocallaws\">Better know your local laws</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock has an ongoing series looking at state public records laws.

Filing your own request at the local, state, and national level takes less than a minute:    </p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"border:1px solid #ddd;\">\r\n<video loop controls>\r\n  <source src=\"http://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/files_static/mockup_vids/Request%20Video_Final.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\r\n</video></div>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<h1><b>Clone a requested document.</b></h1>\r\n<p>Not sure what to request? With our clone feature, any completed request can be filed again to another agency. For example, after you request for a list of lottery Keno sales in Massachusetts from the Massachusetts State Lottery, you can also request the same thing in New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"border:1px solid #ddd;\">\r\n<video loop controls>\r\n  <source src=\"http://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/files_static/mockup_vids/Cloning%20Video_Final.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\r\n</video>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<h1><b>Multi-request a document from many agencies.</b></h1>\r\n<p>Thinking of doing an audit, or some other wide-ranging FOIA project? Pro Users can use the multirequest feature to send the same request to multiple agencies at the same time. For example, if you were looking to compare the policies and reporting requirements regarding solitary confinement at a state and national level in Arizona, you could request documents from the Federal Prison Industry correctional program, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Arizona State Prison Complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"border:1px solid #ddd;\">\r\n<video loop controls>\r\n  <source src=\"http://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/files_static/mockup_vids/Multi-request_Final.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\r\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\r\n</video></div>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<h1><b>Embargo your documents and keep it private.</b></h1>\r\n<p>Working on a public records story and don't want to be scooped?

So instead of asking how many dogs live in your city, <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/foi/arlington-450/dog-registration-data-arlington-town-clerk-9900/\">ask for the dog license registry</a>.\r\nAlmost everything the government does creates some paper trail, whether that\u2019s a log, a report, a presentation before a big project, <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/foi/united-states-of-america-10/hurricane-katrina-lessons-learned-1894/\">lessons learned after a natural disaster</a>, or <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/foi/united-states-of-america-10/dhs-oia-threat-of-radicalization-and-extremism-intranet-224/\">even a copy of an agency\u2019s Intranet page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the important thing is to file something.\r\nVery successful requesters, like Jason Leopold, <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/2013/jul/12/jason-leopold-foia-terrorist-shares-his-transparen/\">file a dozen or more requests a week</a>.\r\nNot all of them will be successful, but filing a number of requests today increases the chances that interesting material will be returned in the weeks and months to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start filing, use the &#8220;Create a FOIA Request&#8221; button on the top of any page on MuckRock.\r\nYou will compose the request using a short form will walk you through the information we need to file it.\r\nBasically, decide what kind of question your trying to get answered, then figure out which level of government is likely to have records with answers to that question.\r\nWe maintain a database of thousands of agencies at all levels of government and across almost every jurisdiction.\r\nGenerally, just type the first few letters of an agency&#8217;s name and we&#8217;ll show the ones we know about.\r\nOccasionally, we won&#8217;t have the agency saved.\r\nIf you enter the agency&#8217;s name and jurisdiction, we will take care of finding their contact information.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"https://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Filing%20Screen.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"yourone-stopfoiashop\">Your one-stop FOIA shop</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Filing requests through MuckRock starts at just $20 to file up to four requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We send and receive all requests and responses on your behalf.\r\nThis is done instantly and electronically, for the most part.\r\nFor agencies still stuck in the 20th century, we&#8217;ll scan and digitize any records that come in by mail.\r\nYour request page is a permanent archive you can share with a link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it&#8217;s time to follow up on a request with a delinquent agency, we can follow up on the request automatically.\r\nIf an agency needs more details, we&#8217;ll flag the request and give you the chance to respond.\r\nSometimes agencies require fees to be paid before they&#8217;ll deliver your documents.\r\nYou can securely pay these fees through MuckRock, and we&#8217;ll make sure they get to the agency.\r\nOr, if the fees are outside your budget, start a crowdfund to raise the money.\r\nWe offer a toolset that is informed by years of experience (and frustration!) with the process of requesting public records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you a journalist or researcher who use public records professionally? Consider a <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/accounts/\">Professional account</a>, with the ability to embargo requests, file at a highly reduced rate, file to multiple agencies at once, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you represent an organization that is looking to embrace FOIA in a big way? We offer <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/accounts/\">Organization accounts</a> with scaled pricing and a shared pool of requests for all members to share. Organization members also get access to all Pro features, as well as the ability to embargo permanently.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"asktheexperts\">Ask the experts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock offers a free question-and-answer space to throw out your trickiest public records problems, where some of the best filers on the planet come to offer their advice and insight. <a href=\"https://localhost:8000/questions/new/\">Ask away!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"followthepros\">Follow the pros</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MuckRock regularly interviews FOIA experts for their advice on what they\u2019ve learned.

A broad request asking for all documents \u201cpertaining to\u201d a topic is more likely to be refused than a more specific request.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/2014/feb/14/requesters-voice-cj-ciaramella/\">C.J. Ciaramella</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>If you have a \u201csensitive\u201d FOIA request or are getting jerked around, request the processing notes for it to see what the agency is saying about it. Always appeal if you get rejected. Know as much of the laws and court precedents as you can.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://localhost:8000/news/archives/2013/jul/12/jason-leopold-foia-terrorist-shares-his-transparen/\">Jason Leopold</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>FOIA requesters must know everything there is to know about the subject matter for which they are seeking responsive records.

If the entire story is based on their request, they must be referenced within the first two sentences.</li>\r\n<li><b>Colons</b> The first word after a colon is not capitalized.</li>\r\n<li><b>Commas</b> MuckRock uses the Oxford comma in series with three or more items.</li>\r\n<li><b>Headlines</b> Headlines are in sentence case.</li>\r\n<li><b>Mind Reading</b> Documents do not let us know what people actually feel or think. Avoid attributing thoughts or feelings, instead relying on what is actually stated. i.e. \"He wrote that he was angry\" instead of \"He was angry.\". Avoid attributing intent behind actions, particularly malice. Show, don't tell.</li>\r\n<li><b>MuckRock</b> MuckRock is always camelcased.</li>\r\n<li><b>Pull Quotes</b> Use off pull quotes is encouraged. The code is <code> &#123;% pullquote \"This is an example\" sharing=True % \t&#125;</code>. Sharing is not required, but is True by default</li>\r\n<li><b>Screencaps</b> If a sentence is broken up by an image, capitalize words as if the sentence was not interrupted. An ellipsis is used to mark where the sentence is paused for the image.</li>\r\n<li><b>User Submits</b> When launching a user submit, make sure it includes fields for MuckRock username; real name; email address; tick box to join MuckRock mailing list and any related project lists, if applicable. User submits should be created with the requests@muckrock.com Google Apps account, and never with a personal email account. Make sure to have an end date for the submit stated in the article and create a reminder in the Staff Calendar. All stories with user submits should be tagged \"Call To Action.\" Submit forms should be given a height long enough so that the user doesn't need to scroll within them; typically, you can just change the embed height to around 1200.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Address style guide</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When writing post office box information, correct style is \"PO Box\" and then the number, per USPS' usage.</li>\r\n<li>If there's both a working street address and PO Box, use the PO box for mailing address.</li>\r\n<li>Don't use both a PO Box and street address.</li>\r\n</ul>",

If it doesn&#8217;t, then an error will be raised.\r\nFiling a request without the required data, or with an agency that doesn&#8217;t belong to the jurisdiction, will return a HTTP 400 error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filing a request through the API will subtract from your account&#8217;s available FOIA request count.\r\nIf no requests have been purchased, the request will be saved as a draft but not sent.\r\nAfter purchasing more requests from your account page, the draft request can be filed manually.\r\nFiling a request without any purchased requests will return a HTTP 402 error.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"questions\">Questions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Reach out to us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/muckrock\">Twitter</a> or by <a href=\"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">email</a>.</p>",

Some records may be completely or partially withheld if the information falls under one or more of <a href = \"http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exemptions\" target=\"_blank\">nine exemptions</a> and <a href =\"http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#exclusions\" target=\"_blank\">three exclusions</a>.

However, you can share requests with others who do not have an account: The site generates a private URL for them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"q16\"></a>\r\n<h2>Do I have to pay for the service?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nNope! \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"q18\"></a>\r\n<h2>Would you sell my data?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nDefinitely not. We respect your privacy and only collect the necessary information to generate a FOIA request. Occasionally we create reports about how the system is working and who is using it, but no identifying information will ever be published.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"q20\"></a>\r\n<h2>How do I know if my request was submitted?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nYou must manually submit your request to the agency directly. Afterwards, we recommend you call to make sure that they received it and are processing it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"q22\"></a>\r\n<h2>How do I track the progress of my request?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nYou can track your requests by logging into FOIA Machine, where you will find your dashboard. Here, you can add new communications, notes of conversations, and update the overall status of your request.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"q23\"></a>\r\n<h2>Has anything changed from the original version of FOIA Machine?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe primary features remain the same, allowing users to create, track and share FOIA request. The current version of FOIA Machine is still up and running and will be until March 31, 2017. At that point, all users and requests will be migrated over to the updated platform. The new FOIA Machine is currently in an <a href = \"https://beta.foiamachine.org\">Open Beta phase</a> and looking for feedback, bug reports, feature requests, and contributors, <a href = \"mailto:info@muckrock.com\">so please get in touch</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Future versions of FOIA Machine \u2014 including the current beta site \u2014  will not be able to send a request via email. Each user will be able to create requests and will be provided with suggested contacts and instructions on how to send your request. Although helpful in some cases, email functionality posed various technical and security issues that complicated the user experience in prior versions of FOIA Machine.</p>\r\n<p>The original FOIA Machine source code will <a href = \"https://github.com/MuckRock/FOIAMachine\">remain available to those interested in hosting their own version</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"q24\"></a>\r\n<h2>How do I contact you?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nEmail <a href = \"mailto:info@foiamachine.org\">info at foiamachine.org</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>",

Metadata associated with every communication included as part of your request shall also be collected and stored. This may include the name of sender, name of receiver, data and time sent, whether it is to or from the user, whether the request uses HTML, the contents of the body of the message, whether that communication changed the status of the request, how may pages an attachment, a description of an attachment, and a copy of an attached file. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> <strong>How we share information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except as noted below, FOIA Machine does not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties unless you give us your permission or we need to share such information in order to provide the services you have requested.

If we cease operation, your information may be transferred to and used by another company that offers similar or related products or services. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> <strong>How Long Will We Store This Information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the length of the typical public records process and the length of these documents' usefulness, we will store this information indefinitely. Should you no longer wish information from a request you filed through the site to be stored by FOIA Machine, you must send a request via e-mail to info@muckrock.com.

Once such changes become effective, your continued use of the Site or App will signify your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, or any revised Privacy Policy, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Site and App.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have questions or comments about our Privacy Policy, please send an e-mail to info@muckrock.com. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This Privacy Policy was last modified on Nov 26, 2016.</em></p>",

Looking to share a great story? Join the MuckRock FOIA Slack channel!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MuckRock Slack channel is a free, collaborative discussion forum to discuss both the federal Freedom of Information Act as well as state public records laws. We do ask that members follow the community guidelines listed below and understand that while we encourage courtesy and respecting the privacy of the forum, just as with any public mailing list, we cannot guarantee discussions had in the forum will stay in the forum. In other words, <strong>don't say anything in here you wouldn't want made public</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have regularly scheduled Slack chats, typically on Tuesdays and Fridays, to discuss particular issues with FOIA and public records. You can <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=pacrulftaspcvvhb8qnq6cj58g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York\">browse upcoming chats here</a> or below, (Times are Eastern Time by default) or  <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/pacrulftaspcvvhb8qnq6cj58g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics\">subscribe with your calendar app here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=Calendar></a><h1>Calendar</h1>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?mode=AGENDA&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=pacrulftaspcvvhb8qnq6cj58g%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%232952A3&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York\" style=\"border-width:0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<a name=Guidelines></a><h1>Guidelines</h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>MuckRock FOIA Slack Community Guidelines</h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The goal of MuckRock\u2019s community Slack channel is to help foster knowledge, understanding, and use of the Freedom of Information Act and public records law among journalists, researchers, and the general public. To this end, our goal is to offer a welcoming environment, focusing on constructive dialogue around records requesting and government transparency.</p>\r\n<p>To keep this a focused forum, we do not tolerate arguments among group members or any type of hostility or insulting behavior. And we are serious about moderating the group. If you violate our guidelines you may be immediately removed. In most cases you may be allowed to join again, but with the expectation that you will abide by these guidelines. Repeat offenders of these guidelines will be banned from the group. </p>\r\n<p>We may delete contributions or block contributors that:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Make allegations against individuals or organizations that go beyond what is necessary to help frame a public records request.\r\n</li><li>Offensive language\r\n</li><li>Personal attacks of any kind\r\n</li><li>SHOUTING (in all caps) or hostility \r\n</li><li>Screen capping of conversations or quoting members without their permission outside of the Slack channel.\r\n</li><li>\u201c@ mentioning\u201d someone in a way that is harassing or excessive.\r\n</li><li>Content that's not relevant to the topic of public records, except in designated, \u201coff topic\u201d channels.\r\n</li><li>Marketing or spam\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Please be aware that we may remove comments from this group for any reason and that group members who violate these guidelines may also be removed.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Due to the size of this Slack channel group, and the fact that it\u2019s growing, deleting comments and removing members who violate these guidelines are important to ensuring the group stays constructive.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>You are the other element crucial to the success of this group. Online conversations thrive when there is mutual respect and cooperation. And working as a team to help moderate yourself and others will help conversation remain constructive and respectful. If you would like to flag anything for review, please email <a href='mailto:info@muckrock.com'>info@muckrock.com</a> or direct message Michael Morisy.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Just a few other things to remember:</p>\r\n<ul><li>This forum is not completely private. While we ask members to follow basic courtesy and ask for permission before quoting members, do not state anything that you would be uncomfortable with have escape to the public.\r\n</li><li>This community includes a wide range of people, including journalists, scholars, lawyers, activists, and many other permutations of requester. We want to support the general community with the goal of a more transparent government.\r\n</li><li>Online conversations are different from face-to-face conversations. Tone of voice and facial expressions don\u2019t translate. Sarcasm, jokes and emoticons, like the smiley face sticking its tongue out, don\u2019t always translate.\r\n</li><li>Dominating the discussion can end it. Look for ways to consolidate several comments into one \u2013 you\u2019ll often prompt more thoughtful responses.</li>\r\n<li>All capital letters = yelling. Please use them sparingly.</li>\r\n<li>Don't be a \"know it all.\" Everyone in this group has expertise. \r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Thanks again for your contributions.
